Lesson 1: Get started column_separator
In Lesson 1, you learn how to work with the Kotlin REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interactive shell, and you practice using the basic syntax of Kotlin code.

Lesson 2: Kotlin basics column_separator
In Lesson 2, you learn how to use Kotlin data types, operators, and variables, and how to work with booleans and conditions. You explore the difference between nullable and non-nullable variables, and you practice using arrays, lists, and loops in Kotlin.

Lesson 3: Functions column_separator
In Lesson 3, you learn how to create a program with a main() function and arguments in IntelliJ IDEA. You create small programs as you learn about default values, compact functions, list filters, basic lambdas, and higher-order functions.

Lesson 4: Classes and objects column_separator
In Lesson 4, you learn about classes, objects, and inheritance in Kotlin. You create small programs as you learn about abstract classes, interfaces, and interface delegation.

Lesson 5.1: Extensions column_separator
In Lesson 5.1, you learn about collections, constants, and extension functions in Kotlin. You create small programs as you learn about pairs, triples, lists, and hash maps for storing data, and implement extension functions to add functionality to existing classes.

Lesson 5.2: Generics column_separator
In Lesson 5.2, you learn about generic classes, methods, and functions in Kotlin. You create a type hierarchy, make classes more flexible by making them generic, and extend their functionality with generic methods and functions.

Lesson 6: Functional manipulation column_separator
In Lesson 6, you learn about annotations, labeled breaks, and Single Abstract Methods (SAMs). You also review lambdas and higher-order functions. You then create and use lambdas and higher-order functions, and learn about higher-order functions in the Kotlin Standard Library.

Android Kotlin Fundamentals column_separator
The Android Kotlin Fundamentals course was created by the Google Developers Training team. In the course, you learn Android Kotlin programming concepts and build a variety of apps.

The Android Kotlin Fundamentals course materials include:

Course codelabs
Starter apps and solution code in GitHub for apps that you create in the codelabs

Lesson 1: Build your first app column_separator
Lesson 1 teaches you how to set up Android Studio to use Kotlin and how to build apps. You start with "Hello World" and move up to an app that uses image files and a click handler. You learn how Android projects are structured, how to use and modify views in your Kotlin Android app, and how to make sure your apps are backward-compatible. You also learn about API levels and the Android Jetpack libraries.
line_end
Lesson 2: Layouts column_separator
In Lesson 2, you learn how to use the Android Studio Layout Editor to create linear layouts and constraint layouts. You create apps that get and display user input, respond to user taps, and change the visibility and color of views. This lesson also teaches you how to use data binding to eliminate inefficient calls to the findViewById() method.

Lesson 3: Navigation column_separator
In Lesson 3, you learn how to create useful navigation in an app. You create a fragment and add it to an app, then add navigation to the app using the Android Studio navigation graph. You add a navigation drawer and an options menu to your app, and you work with the app's back stack, changing the destination of the system Back button. Finally, you learn how to invoke an external activity from within the app.

Lesson 4: Activity and fragment lifecycles column_separator
In Lesson 4, you learn about the activity and fragment lifecycles, and you learn how to manage complex lifecycle situations. You work with a starter app that contains several bugs related to the Android lifecycle. You add logging to the app to better understand the app's lifecycle events, and you fix the bugs that the app contains and add some enhancements to the app. You also learn about Android Jetpack's lifecycle library, which can help you manage lifecycle events with code that's better organized and easier to maintain.
line_end
Lesson 5: Architecture components column_separator
Lesson 5 teaches you how to use ViewModel and LiveData objects. You learn how to use ViewModel objects to enable data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations. You convert an app's UI data into encapsulated LiveData and add observer methods that are notified when the value of the LiveData changes.

You also integrate LiveData and ViewModel with data binding so that the views in your layout communicate directly with ViewModel objects, without using the app's fragments to relay information. This technique simplifies your code and eliminates the need for click handlers in the UI controllers.
